# 🌍 Pollu-Map

**Pollu-Map** is an AI-powered, white-label pollution monitoring and visualization platform that creates high-resolution air quality maps using data from distributed third-party sensors.

This repository represents a **prototype** developed for the **INFOMATRIX competition**.

---

## 🚩 Problem
Air pollution monitoring typically relies on a limited number of expensive fixed stations.  
This results in:
- Low spatial resolution
- Undetected local pollution hotspots
- Limited real-time adaptability

---

## 💡 Solution
Pollu-Map aggregates data from **affordable, commercially available third-party air-quality sensors** and applies AI-driven analysis to generate detailed, real-time pollution maps.

The platform is offered as a **white-label software solution**, allowing cities, schools, and companies to deploy it under their own branding without manufacturing or supplying sensors.

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. Third-party air-quality sensors are deployed across multiple locations  
2. Sensor data is collected and transmitted to the platform  
3. AI processes the data to estimate pollution levels and detect patterns  
4. Results are visualized on an interactive pollution map

## 🧠 AI & Data Processing (Prototype)

### Current Prototype Features
- Simulated pollution sensor datasets
- Basic data preprocessing
- Pollution level classification
- Static map visualizations

### Planned AI Enhancements
- **Air-quality prediction** for surrounding areas using spatial modeling
- **Optimal sensor placement recommendations** based on coverage gaps
- Anomaly detection across sensor networks
- Trend analysis and short-term pollution forecasting

---

## 📊 White-Label Platform Model
Pollu-Map provides **software, analytics, and visualization**, while sensors are sourced independently.

Clients receive:
- Custom-branded dashboards
- AI-powered pollution analytics
- Flexible integration with existing sensor hardware
- Scalable deployment without hardware lock-in

---

## 📈 Scalability
AI development is a fixed cost distributed across deployments.  
As sensor coverage increases, analytical accuracy improves while **cost per deployment decreases**, supporting scalable growth.
