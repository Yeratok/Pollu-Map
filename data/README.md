# 📊 Sensor Data

This directory contains **simulated air-quality sensor datasets** used for demonstrating the Pollu-Map prototype.

All data is artificially generated and does not represent real-world measurements.

---

## Purpose
The datasets in this folder are used to:
- Demonstrate data ingestion from third-party sensors
- Test pollution analysis and classification logic
- Support prototype-level prediction and visualization
- Illustrate how sensor placement affects map resolution

---

## Included Datasets

### `sample_sensor_data.csv`
- Single sensor
- Time-series pollution measurements
- Used for basic preprocessing and classification

### `multi_station_data.csv`
- Multiple sensors across different locations
- Used to simulate city-scale pollution mapping
- Suitable for spatial prediction and sensor placement experiments

---

## Notes
- Sensor values and locations are illustrative
- Data formats follow common IoT air-quality schemas
- No proprietary or real sensor data is included
