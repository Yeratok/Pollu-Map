# 🗺️ Maps & Visualizations

This folder contains **visual outputs** of the Pollu-Map prototype, demonstrating how air-quality data is presented to end users.

The maps are generated from **simulated or aggregated sensor data** and serve to illustrate the functionality of the platform. They include both static mockups and example heatmaps.

---

## Included Files

- `demo_pollution_map.png`  
  A sample pollution heatmap showing air-quality levels across a simulated area.  
  Demonstrates color-coded pollution intensity (low → green, moderate → orange, high → red).

- `dashboard_mockup.png` *(optional)*  
  Conceptual mockup of the Pollu-Map dashboard interface, showing:
  - Map view with sensor locations
  - Pollution hotspots
  - Air-quality trend summaries
  - AI-generated sensor placement suggestions

---

## Purpose

- Provide a **visual representation of pollution levels** for prototype evaluation
- Demonstrate **how AI predictions** could be displayed spatially
- Support the **white-label dashboard concept** by showing client-facing layouts
- Allow reviewers and judges to quickly understand the platform's outputs without running the code

---

## Notes

- All maps are **conceptual or simulated** and do not reflect real-time pollution.
- In a production system, these visualizations would be **interactive**, showing live data and predictive insights.
- Future versions could include **dynamic heatmaps**, filters for pollutant type, and trend analysis overlays.
